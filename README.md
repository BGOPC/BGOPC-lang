# BGOPC-lang

this is a language which i made
i spend 1 week to make
this language has about 20 built-in-functions and about 15 commands
i would love if you guys update this and make it better
files should have .lopc extension
else it will return runtime error and says incorrect extension
you can use One line code with runnig Shell.py
if you wanna run a file you should type
``Run("filename.lopc")``
